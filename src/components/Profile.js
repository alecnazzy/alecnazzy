        I'm currently studying computer science at Florida International
        University in conjunction with serving in the Army National Guard. I am
        very passionate about web development, UX design, and learning new
        technologies to play around with and improve my skills. When I am not
        coding, I enjoy lifting weights, traveling, and hanging out with my dog
        Tobey.
